# Yali Liu - Portfolio

## Project Description
This project originated from a UX I class design created using Figma for a personal portfolio. Transitioning into Web Dev II, the implementation began with coding in HTML. The subsequent integration of Bootstrap classes facilitated the creation of a foundational layout, complemented by custom CSS for optimaize visual effects.

## Challenges
Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges, particularly in customizing Bootstrap properties such as the gradient button. Overcoming this hurdle involved leveraging a CSS gradient builder tool to fine-tune the desired visual elements. 

Another notable challenge was image optimization. Given the extensive use of images within the website, this process proved time-consuming. Striving to strike a balance between image quality and page load speed, I explored various optimization techniques. This challenge not only honed my skills in image optimization but also deepened my understanding of accessibility.

## Lessons Learned
This project provided valuable learning experiences. Working with both Figma and Bootstrap deepened my understanding of design-to-development workflows. The challenges faced enhanced my problem-solving skills, and the overall process enriched my knowledge in Acceccibility, user-centered design and web development.
